In 1891 this increased to\n            12, in 1925 it was revised once more to 14, then again to 16 in 1840, and yet again to <strong>18<\/strong>\n            in 2013. <\/p>\n\n        <p>What this means socially is that sexual activity with a minor below this age &#8211; known as the\n            <strong>&#8216;statutory minimum age&#8217;<\/strong> &#8211; in any capacity is considered &#8216;rape&#8217;. In 2012, the age of consent\n            was revised to make the law a gender-neutral concept and to include the very real concept of sexual abuse of\n            minor boys. Today, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act has affixed the age of consent for\n            all children to 18 years of age.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <strong>Do you think that individuals have an age at which they can make fully informed decisions for their\n                own well-being?<\/strong>\n            <strong>Do you think children and minors should be counted as individuals capable of giving informed\n                consent?<\/strong>\n            <strong>What are some factors you think might prevent minors from giving informed consent?<\/strong>\n\n            <strong>What is the age of consent in India?<\/strong>\n            <ol>\n                <li>14<\/li>\n                <li>16<\/li>\n                <li>18<\/li>\n                <li>21<\/li>\n            <\/ol>\n\n            <strong>What is the age of consent in India?<\/strong>\n            <ol>\n                <li>18<\/li>\n                <li>19<\/li>\n                <li>14<\/li>\n                <li>21<\/li>\n            <\/ol>\n\n            <strong>What is the legal age of marriage for boys in India?<\/strong>\n\n            <ol>\n                <li>19<\/li>\n                <li>21<\/li>\n                <li>21<\/li>\n                <li>25<\/li>\n            <\/ol>\n        <\/div>\n        <p>At home, at workplaces, at social gatherings, or even on the street as sexual harassment in the form of\n            catcalling, commenting on one\u2019s body in a public space, groping, unwanted physical contact in spaces such as\n            metros and crowded public transport, \u2013 <strong>it is important to recognise and affirm for ourselves that we\n                are always and completely eligible to voice our discomfort and uphold our personal boundaries.<\/strong>\n        <\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"chapter-3\">\n        <h2 class=\"main-head\">Chapter 3: Basic SRH Hygiene and Wellbeing<\/h2>\n        <p>There is a prevalent, overpowering stigma attached to the term \u2018sex\u2019, particularly in India, which\n            drastically reduces the scope for nuanced dialogue and discussion on sexual awareness and education, making\n            conversation practically taboo and further perpetuating women\u2019s subjugation and disenfranchisement. <\/p>\n        <p>While sex in itself is only vaguely alluded to in common parlance, issues such as abortion, contraceptives,\n            STIs, pregnancy related complications, and family planning are forbidden topics of conversation, relegated\n            to whispers and rumours &#8212; which, in turn, leads to misinterpretation of facts, dissemination of incorrect\n            information, polarisation of mindsets, making sex itself a deeply uncomfortable topic for most people. Given\n            this, it is all the more necessary to treat the topic of SRH as a concrete, developmental goal, and to find\n            ways of navigating the same efficiently and sensitively. <\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.khushii.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/image2.png\" alt=\"\">\n        <\/div>\n        <p>It is important to recognise the different areas that are covered within the ambit of SRH, in order to make\n            the correct choices for one\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing (which, inevitably, implies taking agency over\n            one\u2019s own body.)

While there are over a 100 types of HPV, approximately 14\n                    of these types are known to cause serious health problems like cervical cancer. Additionally,\n                    non-cancerous types of HPV are also known to be the cause of other issues like genital warts, and\n                    can even cause the development of tumorous warts lining the respiratory tract. While there is no\n                    treatment for HPV itself, the HPV vaccine and the Gardasil 9 vaccine are effective in prevention of\n                    the disease, and the genital warts caused by HPV are routinely treated using standard dermatological\n                    procedures like using electric current or liquid nitrogen. Cancerous warts, however, are usually\n                    treated by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or even surgery.\n                <\/li>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Genital Herpes: <\/strong>Genital herpes is another STI that is fairly common. The infection\n                    is known to cause the formation of blisters and sores that are painful and pus-filled. There are two\n                    types of the herpes simplex virus that cause different illnesses &#8212; the HSV-1 virus which usually\n                    causes cold sores, and the HSV-2 virus which causes genital herpes. If left untreated, herpes can\n                    lead to severe health damage including swelling of lymph nodes, headaches, body pain, fever, and\n                    even blindness, brain damage, and death for babies who contract the virus during pregnancy or\n                    childbirth. While contemporary treatments using antiviral drugs like acyclovir (Zovirax),\n                    famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) helps treat symptoms of genital herpes, the herpes\n                    simplex virus itself cannot be cured.\n                <\/li>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Syphilis:<\/strong>Unlike HPV and genital herpes which are viral infections (caused by a\n                    virus), syphilis is a common STI caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. Usually, the most common\n                    symptom of syphilis is the development of a small sore on the genitals, anus, or inside the mouth.\n                    This makes it easy to ignore for patients, and hence syphilis is an infection that is difficult to\n                    diagnose. If left untreated, the STI can cause severe damage to vital organs like the brain and the\n                    heart in the long run. However, it is comparatively less contagious than herpes and HPV because it\n                    only spreads through direct contact with the syphilitic sores, which are called chancres. One of the\n                    most effective treatments for syphilis is the use of penicillin, although doxycycline, azithromycin,\n                    and ceftriaxone are also used to treat patients who are allergic to penicillin.\n                <\/li>\n                <li><strong>Chancroid:<\/strong>Another common bacterial STI, similar to syphilis, is chancroid. Caused\n                    by the bacteria <i>Haemophilus ducreyi,<\/i> the most telling symptom of chancroid is the formation\n                    of open sores in the genital region that are often like ulcers. These open sores may often bleed or\n                    produce secretions that spread the infection. Additionally, skin-to-skin contact with someone\n                    infected with chancroid also is a mode of transmission of the disease. Untreated cases of chancroid\n                    can lead to permanent scarring in the gential region, in addition to increasing the risk of\n                    contracting other STIs. Studies show that people infected with chancroid are more likely to contract\n                    HIV, and also pose a higher risk of transmission of HIV. Chancroids are usually treated with the use\n                    of antibiotics that kill the bacteria that causes the ulcers. The most commonly used antibiotics for\n                    this are azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin.\n                <\/li>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Chlamydia: <\/strong> Chlamydia is another bacterial STI that is commonly prevalent in India.\n                    Unlike most other STIs, people infected with chlamydia often show no symptoms in the early stages of\n                    infection. However, the disease grows more deadly and can cause drastic health damage if left\n                    unchecked. In the later stages, common symptoms of chlamydia include burning sensation during\n                    urination, yellow\/green discharge from the penis, testicular and abdominal pain, inflammation of the\n                    cervix, bleeding between periods, pain during intercourse, and vaginal discharge. In women,\n                    chlamydia can also reach the fallopian tubes and cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which requires\n                    urgent medical attention. Treating chlamydia is relatively simple, and antibiotics like azithromycin\n                    and doxycycline are routinely used to treat the infections.\n                <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/p>\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <strong>Why do you think it\u2019s important to learn about the symptoms of different STIs?<\/strong>\n            <strong>Do you think STIs are dangerous?

Studies show that in 2019, there were roughly 69,000 new cases of HIV, with an estimated national\n            figure of 23 lakh people living with HIV in the country.\n        <\/p>\n        <p>Looking at these statistics, it is clear that the first step towards combating the spread of STIs and STDs in\n            the country must necessarily be an increase in resources, opportunities, and access to sexual and\n            reproductive health education. This is something that must not only be supported by the government, but must\n            be made mandatory in school curriculums across the country to ensure that people are taught about STIs, how\n            to recognize them, how to prevent them, how to treat them, and how to manage them from a young age.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <strong>What do you think are some ways to prevent STIs?<\/strong>\n            <strong>What role does education play in preventing the spread of STIs?<\/strong>\n        <\/div>\n        <p>When it comes to preventing STIs, there are several things that one can do to protect themselves and the\n            people around them from these contagious diseases. Some of the most effective and common ways of preventing\n            STIs are as follows:<\/p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Practicing safe sex:<\/strong> It is important to remember to practice safe sex if you are\n                sexually active &#8212; especially if you are engaging with multiple sexual partners. Using latex condoms\n                during sexual intercourse is an extremely effective way of reducing the risk of both, unwanted pregnancy\n                as well as STIs.<\/li>\n\n            <li><strong>Maintaining hygiene:<\/strong>Make it a point to always wash your genitals before and after\n                engaging in sexual activity. This helps ensure that your genitals are always clean and healthy. Another\n                thing to remember is to avoid sharing towels and undergarments as they can also cause unwanted contact\n                with contagious STIs. Additionally, another effective precaution is to wash your hands regularly.<\/li>\n\n            <li><strong>Regular testing and screening:<\/strong>If you are sexually active, make it a point to regularly\n                get yourself tested and screened for common STIs. Encourage your sexual partner(s) to do the same, and\n                make sure to discuss test results and treatment strategies if needed.<\/li>\n            <li><strong>Vaccinations:<\/strong> Vaccinations to prevent common STIs are easily available and administered\n                in most hospitals, clinics, OB-GYN clinics, and urologist clinics. The Gardasil 9 vaccine is effective\n                in prevention of 9 types of HPV, penicillin has been found to be extremely effective in treating cases\n                of syphilis, chancroid can be effectively treated through medication or surgery, and chlamydia is easily\n                treated with antibiotics. The only STI that proves to be difficult is herpes, because there is no cure\n                for the disease, and treatment is largely oriented towards treating the symptoms of herpes.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n        <p>In India, sex is a topic of conversation that is surprisingly considered to be taboo and better avoided in\n            discussions &#8212; a fact that is all the more rich in irony when we take a moment to remember that India is the\n            largest democracy in the world, the second most populous nation on planet. Not only is sex education largely\n            missing from school curriculums and educational programs at any level in the country, simply engaging in\n            conversations on sex, menstrual health, and reproductive health often comes with severe social ridicule and\n            rebuke. <\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.khushii.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/image4.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <strong>Why do you think people avoid talking about STIs? <\/strong>\n            <strong>Do you think school should teach you about STIs?<\/strong>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <p>With most of the Indian population lacking access to adequate resources and opportunities to educate\n            themselves about safe and healthy sexual practices, sexual and reproductive health continues to be\n            much-ignored aspect of healthcare, wellbeing, and empowerment initiatives &#8212; something that often\n            disproportionately disadvantages women who are \u201ctraditionally\u201d discouraged from navigating their own journey\n            with menstruation, which is considered an \u201cimpure\u201d and taboo topic in Indian society and culture.<\/p>\n\n        <p>While the above methods are indeed extremely effective in preventing and treating common STIs, it is vital to\n            understand what are sexually transmitted infections, how do they spread, what are the symptoms, and what are\n            the risks associated in order to truly and effectively treat an STI. In this light, the most effective (and\n            the most important) weapon against a widespread outbreak of STIs is education. In the absence of larger\n            structures of support and education with regards to sexual and reproductive health, while it is important to\n            adhere to the above preventative measures as much as possible, it is equally important to learn more about\n            different sexually transmitted diseases, how to identify their symptoms, and how to prevent and treat them.\n        <\/p>\n\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2 class=\"left\">Quiz!<\/h2>\n            <p>4.

Growing up, a false idea regarding contraceptives prevails \u2014 that they\n            are only for preventing pregnancies. While this is in part the truth, this view leaves out the immensely\n            important point that contraceptives are key to preventing the transmission of STIs. In other words, knowing\n            how to use contraceptives is key to maintaining your sexual health.<\/p>\n\n        <p>There are a wide range of contraceptives available in India, from condoms and pills to IUDs and diaphragms.\n            While preference does play a role in determining what contraceptive one uses, it is important to consider\n            that some contraceptives are effective in different ways than others.

It is also quite easy\n            to use: simply pull it over an erect penis. Aside from this, condoms have other benefits as well \u2014 they\n            prevent STIs, are easy to carry and unlike some other contraceptives, don\u2019t have any hormonal impact.\n            However one should be careful that the condom does not tear or come off during intercourse.<\/p>\n        <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.khushii.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/image6.png\" alt=\"\">\n        <\/div>\n        <h2 class=\"left\">The Oral Contraceptive Pill<\/h2>\n\n        <p>The oral contraceptive pill commonly used by women is the next most popular contraceptive. While the pill can\n            have some benefits &#8211; it is highly effective and may even reduce period pains &#8211; it unfortunately does not\n            prevent the transmission of STIs. Further, it can adversely affect one\u2019s health by causing side effects like\n            nausea, headaches and even depression. It is for this reason that a pill must be prescribed by a medical\n            practitioner.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h2 class=\"left\">The IUD<\/h2>\n\n        <p>The IUD is another contraceptive that requires the expertise of a healthcare provider A longer term mode of\n            contraception, the IUD can remain in place, inside a uterus, for upto 10 years. During this period, it\n            gradually releases hormones that prevent pregnancy. The procedure is entirely reversible and, outside of a\n            small chance of infection, there is no real downside to undertaking it.\n        <\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <strong>Is it difficult for you to speak to your healthcare provider about contraceptives?<\/strong>\n            <strong>Do contraceptives trigger side effects for you?<\/strong>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <h2 class=\"left\">The Diaphragm<\/h2>\n\n        <p>\n            Finally, the diaphragm. Like the condom, the diaphragm creates a physical barrier between the sperm and the\n            uterus. Unlike the condom, the diaphragm is reusable. The diaphragm also needs to stay in place for at least\n            6 &#8211; and no more than 24 &#8211; hours after intercourse. To put on a diaphragm, fold it in half and gently place\n            it inside your vagina. Then, push it up and back, as far as it can go, with the dome facing outward.

A study in 2020 reported that 1 in 3 women in India have experienced some form of\n            domestic abuse. Of these, only 1 in 10 women has reported the abuse to law enforcement or healthcare\n            officials. This shows how rampant, but severely underreported domestic abuse is, in addition to the need for\n            more proactive measures to create safe, sensitive and reliable support structures that are localised to the\n            person\u2019s immediate surroundings. <\/p>\n        <p>While \u2018domestic\u2019 abuse can be used to mean any form of violence from a familial person, it is often used to\n            mean violence inflicted on women and children by members of their family. The umbrella term of domestic\n            abuse encapsulates physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse. These are often not singular\n            incidents but prolonged and systemic forms of abuse. Oftentimes, more than one person within the family is\n            either aware of, or complicit in the crime. <\/p>\n        <p>While domestic abuse against women is relatively discussed about in the public sphere &#8212; through\n            conscientious efforts by activists, NGOs and women\u2019s rights organisations &#8212; another form of abuse, which is\n            both widespread and occurs most often in the domestic sphere is child sexual abuse. As noted in the Human\n            Rights Watch\u2019s 2013 report \u201cBreaking the Silence: Child Sexual Abuse in India,\u201d <\/p>\n        <p class=\"left container-left\">\u201cAs recent research has shown, it is not just within institutions that Indian\n            children suffer from sexual abuse. A 2007 Indian government-sponsored survey, based on interviews with\n            12,500 children in 13 different states, reported serious and widespread sexual abuse, thereby putting the\n            government on notice about the gravity of the problem. Smaller surveys conducted by nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs) have also painted a disturbing picture. Children are sexually abused by relatives at\n            home, by people in their neighborhoods, at school, and in residential facilities for orphans and other\n            at-risk children.

The reason these rights need to be understood separately and seriously is\n            not that the reproductive system doesn\u2019t come under general healthcare; the reason is that women\u2019s health\n            has been significantly de-prioritised from society and consequently from healthcare systems because of the\n            existing patriarchal structures that assume that men\u2019s standards of health are universal.<\/p>\n\n        <p>The accessibility of reproductive health rights, much like that of other social and economic rights, depends\n            on the many intersections of oppression a woman might be situated at. Generally, the poorer women are, the\n            fewer the chances that they would be able to access gynaecological and obstetric care on time, or without\n            social support. Similarly, access to these service providers is dependent on the race, caste, and religion\n            of the woman in some contexts, for abortion, for example, is forbidden both under Islam and under\n            Christianity. Over a period of time, different mechanisms of support, both at the community level and at the\n            policy level, have evolved to guarantee reproductive health rights to women.<\/p>\n\n        <h2 class=\"left\">What are the different reproductive health rights of women?<\/h2>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2 class=\"left\">Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <p>Can you think of what might be the most important reproductive rights for women? Think in the context of\n                a patriarchal world.<\/p>\n            <p>Do you think abortion needs to be made into a significant reproductive right? Why? Why not?<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <p class=\"head\">In general, women have a right to the following:<\/p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><i>Access to abortion<\/i> \u2014 This right is perhaps the most important one, and the one that needs the\n                most rigorous implementation throughout all segments of the population. It is tied to a woman\u2019s right to\n                autonomy over her own body, because pregnancy, apart from being a physically and emotionally challenging\n                time, has consequences in terms of child rearing for the woman. Society has distributed the burden of\n                child rearing labour such that regardless of the stratum a woman belongs to, she becomes the primary\n                caregiver to her children. In this context, it makes sense that the final decision on whether a woman\n                keeps a child or aborts it be the woman\u2019s alone. However, the society has long viewed women and their\n                bodies and their children as the property of men, and it becomes difficult to understand this right to\n                autonomy unless backed by legislation that provides this freedom to women firmly. In India, this is\n                guaranteed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. <\/li>\n            <li><i>Access to birth control<\/i> \u2014 Closely related to the right to abortion is the right to birth control,\n                which works as a more long-term, preventive measure. It also allows women the right to decide how their\n                reproductive system operates, from controlling their menstrual cycles to reducing their menstrual pain\n                to planning future children, or in the case of hysterectomy or tubectomy, deciding never to have\n                children at all.<\/li>\n            <li><i>Access to education \u2014 <\/i>In matters relating to reproductive healthcare and the procedures\n                associated with it, such as contraceptives and surgeries, informed consent is important. No woman should\n                have to undergo a procedure without a thorough, medically up-to-date knowledge of its pros and cons.\n            <\/li>\n            <li>To that end, access to education about these procedures becomes hyper-important. This education can\n                start in schools, when women are just coming into their own, and remain accessible right upto the moment\n                they reach the doctor\u2019s office. <\/li>\n            <li><i>Freedom from genital mutilation \u2014 <\/i>In many parts of the world, young girls undergo genital\n                mutilation owing to societal and religious beliefs. This extremely painful and unnecessary procedure has\n                been widely recognized as a violation of women\u2019s rights over their own bodies, and legislation in place\n                in many countries to stop its practice. In India, the Constitution\u2019s Right to Freedom has been\n                interpreted to include freedom from genital mutilation. <\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h2>How to Implement These Rights?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2>Let\u2019s Talk!<\/h2>\n            <p>What do you think are the possible obstacles that prevent women from accessing their general rights in a\n                fair manner? What about Reproductive Health Rights?<\/p>\n            <p>What might be the possible ways in which women\u2019s rights can be made more accessible to them?<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p>Here are some ways to ensure that women\u2019s healthcare rights are more effectively implemented and accessible\n            in a society\u2014<\/p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><i>Overcoming stigma:<\/i> Depending on the social context, the extent of the stigma around women\u2019s\n                sexual health might take different strategies to be fought against. However, the role of overcoming\n                stigma cannot be overstated because social prejudice causes women to hide their\n                reproductive-system-related illnesses from their families, friends and even doctors. Especially in\n                time-sensitive illnesses such as uterine or cervical cancer, this stigma literally takes lives, as the\n                patients wait too long to bring up symptoms with their doctors, and treatment becomes difficult or\n                impossible at later stages.<\/li>\n            <li><i>Normalising of conversations around reproductive health:<\/i> Conversations around reproductive health\n                are, conventionally, considered taboo in nearly all spaces in a society\u2014 from the family to school to\n                workplaces. Women are taught to fear their bodies and regard their reproductive system as something\n                shameful, right from the moment they get their first period. In such a society, it becomes increasingly\n                difficult for them to bring up any pains, abnormal bleeding, or other symptoms, simply because they know\n                that they are bringing up something that\u2019s \u2018not normal\u2019. The only reason these conversations are\n                considered taboo or abnormal is that it is a question of women\u2019s health, and the taboo feeds into the\n                broader social stigma related to talking about sexuality generally. <\/li>\n            <li><i>Use of the language of rights:<\/i> A powerful aspect of legal discourse is that it can validate\n                experiences that would otherwise be considered without proof or backing. Categorising women\u2019s need for\n                accessible healthcare as a \u2018right\u2019 means that even those who might not believe that abortion or\n                contraception is justified by their personal religion would not be able to exercise that decision for a\n                woman who has sought the procedure. It would also make gynaecological clinics safe spaces for women, for\n                they might feel empowered by the knowledge that they are within their legal rights to ask for the birth\n                control procedure or pill that they would want. <\/li>\n            <li><i>Sensitized gynaecologists:<\/i> Perhaps the most damaging misinformation about women\u2019s reproductive\n                health comes from gynaecologists, who attempt to align women\u2019s choices as per patriarchal norms. For\n                example, telling a woman who wishes to undergo a hysterectomy that she should not undergo it, in case\n                their husband changes his mind later about having children, or dismissing severe menstrual pain as\n                \u2018women\u2019s lot\u2019 or \u2018only a fraction of what you\u2019d feel in childbirth\u2014 get used to it\u2019. This kind of\n                dismissal can be especially damaging given that doctors are authorities\u2014 in the patient\u2019s mind they are\n                authorities not just on the medical aspects of healthcare but also on its legal\/moral aspects. This\n                needs to be changed, for it violates women\u2019s right to autonomy and consent without coercion. <\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n\n        <div class=\"border-box\">\n            <h2 class=\"left\">Quiz:<\/h2>\n            <p>What is the status of abortion under Indian law?<\/p>\n            <p>What role can gynaecologists play in ensuring that women can access their reproductive rights?<\/p>\n            <p>How would you explain the concept of reproductive rights?<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"chapter-8\">\n        <h2>Chapter 8: Medical Services Available for Women\u2019s SRH<\/h2>\n        <p>Citizens of a country need access to proper healthcare systems and resources in order to maintain their\n            sexual and reproductive health. The sexual and reproductive health of women concerns itself with access to\n            medical facilities, to the establishment of knowledge systems that propound upon the importance of\n            contraception, of fertility clinics, of maternal health, of postpartum care and the awareness of\n            sexually-transmitted infections. In a country where women are the victims of social inequities and thereby\n            social injustice, ensuring good sexual and reproductive health is a concerted effort, one that finds itself\n            at the intersection of education and gender advocacy.<\/p>\n        <p>According to a report published by Oxford Research Encyclopedias as a part of Global Public Health, India has\n            been making significant improvements in its treatment of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health. Instead of\n            focusing only on family planning, India has been focusing on the treatment of STIs, curbing maternal\n            mortality, promoting the use of contraception and the presence of skilled doctors and nurses at the time of\n            delivery. By setting up measures to distribute contraception, to manage the consequences of STIs or\n            abortions, India is ensuring that it prioritises the lives of women and their wellbeing over abiding by the\n            societal norms of procreating.<\/p>\n        <p>In keeping with this effort to broaden the spectrum of sexual health and reproduction, there are both\n            government-led and private initiatives that work to provide medical services to women seeking to maintain\n            sexual and reproductive health.
