So much so that she stopped taking part in competitions and games. Her parents, who are daily wagers, did not know what was wrong with her and felt hopeless to see their bright spark dim.<\/p>\n    \n<div style=\"padding: 20px; background-color: rgb(141, 194, 251); color: rgb(252, 252, 252); font-size: 18px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n      <em><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">DYK &#8211; According to World Health Organisation (WHO) data on mental health, every 1 in 3 adolescents will suffer from an anxiety disorder.<\/span><\/em><\/div>\n    \n    <p style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); padding-top:25px; padding-bottom:25px;\">When Arutjothi, KHUSHII&#8217;s mental health counsellor, took an assessment test of the students, she realized that Yuvashree had high anxiety levels and enrolled her on KHUSHII&#8217;s <em>Mental Health Counselling programme &#8211; Manoshakti<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:25px;\">Things changed for the better ever since Yuvashree started with the mental health programme.\nKHUSHII counsellor counselled Yuvashree with her parents and conducted ten focused\ncounselling sessions. Yuvashree, under the guidance of the expert, enthusiastically practised\npositive visualization and colour breathing exercises with guided imagery. After the sessions, the\ncounsellor followed up regularly with Yuvashree, her teachers and her parents for her well-being.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:25px;\">Following the counselling, regular follow-ups and one-to-one meetings, Yuvashree found new\nconfidence in herself and, with vigour, started participating in competitions and games. Recently,\nshe won a gold medal in the Zonal (District) level competition for Silambam. (Silambam is an\nIndian martial art originating in South India.
