One of the impacts is on menstruating girls. Menstrual absorbents are essential for self-respect, physical and psychosocial wellbeing. Lack of access to menstrual absorbents causes girls to miss school. They feel embarrassed going to school during their periods. And use unhygienic materials such as rags instead of pads.<\/p>\n\t\t\n\t<p style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">Dignity kits are means of providing protection, wellbeing, mobility and hygiene for menstruating girls. Periods do not stop for the pandemic. School-aged girls face a shortage of menstrual absorbents as schools, the only supply chain for many, are shut.<\/p>\n    \n<div style=\"padding: 20px; background-color: rgb(141, 194, 251); color: rgb(252, 252, 252); font-size: 18px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n      <em><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">&#8220;We are so relieved to have these sanitary pads!

Along with the &#8216;Dignity Kits, &#8216; KHUSHII also imparts education on menstruation to school-going girls who are approaching puberty. So far, KHUSHII has delivered over 800 dignity kits to girls in two government schools in Mumbai and Rewari. The &#8216;Dignity Kits&#8217; provide all the required sanitary items, including sanitary napkins, soap, hand towel, toothbrush etc., a total of 17 essential items.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"padding: 20px; background-color: rgb(141, 194, 251); color: rgb(252, 252, 252); font-size: 18px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n        <em><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">&#8220;Girls in my class appreciate KHUSHII&#8217;s interventions such as the distribution of dignity kits and sessions on menstrual hygiene.
