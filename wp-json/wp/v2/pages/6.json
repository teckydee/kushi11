This was our chance to use our\n\t\t\t\tcombined experience to make a greater difference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t  <p class=\"FTpopin\">Once&nbsp;Khushii&nbsp;was established, we took our first year to really study and understand\n\t\t\t\tthe needs of our&nbsp;society and the shortcomings,&nbsp;as&nbsp;we did not know which areas we\n\t\t\t\tshould start off with.&nbsp;It is a harsh reality that in our nation there are a number of\n\t\t\t\tconcerns and causes that need&nbsp;to be addressed and improved. It is a mammoth task\n\t\t\t\tto determine who, where, when and how to help, and an even more difficult task to\n\t\t\t\tnot be able to help all those we see are in need. We had a huge thirst to do good\n\t\t\t\twork,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;equally&nbsp;important to us to fine-tune the areas we would work in.\n\t\t\t\tSo&nbsp;we came to the conclusion that lack of education is the core of all problems in our\n\t\t\t\tcountry and keeping that in mind, we channelled our main focus to be Education and\n\t\t\t\tholistic development of lesser privileged children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t  <p class=\"FTpopin\">Our intent was and still is, to be as self-sustainable as possible, whether that would\n\t\t\t\tbe through in-house Fundraising events or through the generous support of our\n\t\t\t\tCorporate Partners.<\/p>\n\t\t\t  <p class=\"FTpopin\">Though our core is Education, Community Development is something that goes\n\t\t\t\thand in hand, keeping in sync with the acronym of our name<strong>&nbsp;Kinship for\n\t\t\t\tHumanitarian Social and Holistic Intervention in India.<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t  <p class=\"FTpopin\">Do take your time to go through our&nbsp;website, and learn about the work that we do at\n\t\t\t\tKhushii.<\/p>\n\t\t\t  <p class=\"FTpopin\">I end this&nbsp;note&nbsp;by encouraging all of you to give&nbsp;Khushii&nbsp;and our&nbsp;Khushii&nbsp;beneficiaries\n\t\t\t\tall the love, support and blessings that many of you have been doing so generously\n\t\t\t\tfrom day one.
